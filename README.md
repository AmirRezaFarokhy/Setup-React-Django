# Setup-React-Django
To add a front-end project for Django, we need a complete configuration, and by running this bash, we can easily complete 80% of the work.

# Usage Guid 
1. After starting a project, you should go to your project path where your `manage.py` was.
2. Clone the repository with this command:
  ```git clone https://github.com/AmirRezaFarokhy/Setup-React-Django.git```
3. Then you run this command to change the mode of the bash file: `chmod +x react_setup.sh`
4. Finally run the bash in your terminal: `./react_setup.sh`
5. Done :)
